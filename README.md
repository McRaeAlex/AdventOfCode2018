# AdventOfCode2018
My progress through Advent of Code https://adventofcode.com/

I am going to write each day in either:
- Go
- Rust
- Haskell
- Python 3
- Java

# Updates:

## Day 6:
Currently I have done them all in python first then if I come up will a 
solution fast in haskell I do it after in haskell. Yesterdays task could 
have easily been done in haskell but I was still more comfortable in python.

## Day 13:
I want to do a visualization for the first part of this maybe the second after.
I need to write to a file each step and then write a python script that converts
thoses .txt files into pngs and the finally converts them to a gif.
